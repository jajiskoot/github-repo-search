## Extra Notes

CSS is very simple, there's a lot of little time consuming css changes that can be done to spruce this up, but in
the spirit of this being a simple code test I chose to focus on bare bones stuff, and features that highlight react
mastery.

Feel free to ask me any other questions you may have about why I designed it certain ways.
